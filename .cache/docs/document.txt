Psychological counseling is difficult to define because it is a process of dealing with human problems. This is because various perspectives and philosophical discussions on the essence of human existence and life have not reached a consistent conclusion. In addition, each psychological counseling expert has a different understanding of the essence of psychological counseling, and there are currently more than 250 psychological counseling theories, and their approaches are also different. Therefore, the counseling process varies depending on the characteristics of the client and the type of problem.
Nevertheless, a definition can be made based on the basic structure of psychological counseling. Psychological counseling consists of three main components: the client, the counselor, and their relationship. Based on this, psychological counseling can be defined as "a learning process in which a person in need of help solves his or her problems through a relationship with a professionally trained person and achieves human growth in thoughts, emotions, and behavior."

Psychological counseling is conducted by building a relationship between the client and the counselor based on several principles. First, the counselor must respect the individuality and unique situation of the client. To this end, the counselor must listen to the client's story without prejudice, observe their behavior, and understand the various principles of human behavior. In addition, a comfortable and warm atmosphere must be created so that the client can freely express his or her feelings, and through this, the counselor can deeply empathize with and accept the client's feelings.
One of the important attitudes of the counselor is a non-judgmental attitude that does not criticize or judge. The counselor must objectively evaluate the client's problems, but must be careful not to make the client feel blamed. In addition, it is important to help the client solve his or her own problems. This is related to the counselor's attitude of trusting the client's potential and providing the client with the opportunity to make his or her own decisions. Finally, confidentiality of the counseling content is a key element in forming trust in the counseling process. The client can talk more freely because he or she is confident that the counselor will not leak his or her story to the outside.

The counselor must have two main qualities: professionalism and human maturity. In terms of professionalism, theoretical understanding and practical experience required for psychological counseling are essential. The counselor must be able to select and apply counseling techniques appropriate for each problem based on extensive knowledge of human psychological problems. This is because a professional approach is required in the process of counseling divided into initial, middle, and final stages. In addition, counseling techniques should be acquired through rich practical experience and expertise should be strengthened through continuous training.
Meanwhile, human qualities are also considered important qualities of counselors. Counselors should be able to understand and accept their own emotions, and have an open mind and warm interest in others. This not only gives clients a sense of trust, but also contributes to effectively leading counseling relationships through emotional maturity and psychological stability. Being able to express deep interest in people through conversation is also one of the important characteristics that counselors should have.

Psychological counselors should maintain a sincere attitude in order to build trust with clients. Counselors should express their emotions honestly without distorting them, but they should be careful not to become overly emotionally involved in the process. Sincerity is revealed when counselors act truthfully in their relationships with clients, and this becomes an important foundation for clients to trust counselors and share their problems openly.
In addition, counselors should show a polite yet active attitude in interactions with clients. They should sincerely pay attention to the client’s story and help the client solve their problems through appropriate feedback. Along with this, counselors must reflect on themselves and maintain a balanced state so that their emotions or attitudes do not have a negative impact on the client.


As someone who suffers from schizophrenia, I find my life challenging. I continually face setbacks in both my personal and professional life, and my symptoms often cause me to feel isolated and lonely. However, despite it all, I've discovered a huge benefit to my issues — I’ve become a more empathetic person.

Following By Example
As soon as I was diagnosed with a mental condition, stigma followed fast behind. Many family members, friends, and acquaintances couldn’t relate to or understand my difficulties with concentrating at work or participating in daily activities. I often felt utterly alone in my struggle.

But I have also experienced incredible empathy from a number of people in my life. Through their understanding, I’ve become stronger as an individual, and I know I’m not alone. One friend in particular has consistently pursued me whenever I've had a loss of interest in daily life or activities; as a result, I’ve been able to become engaged again in the outside world and participate in the hobbies I enjoy. Many of my improvements and progress can be attributed to others around me who have reached out to offer help — even if they can't relate to what I’m going through.

I’ve experienced the power of empathy firsthand, and because of it, I’m motivated to extend empathy to others. Although I may feel powerless — especially after going through all stages of schizophrenia — I've learned how to regain my power by making a difference in other people's lives.

Regaining My Voice
When you're diagnosed with a mental illness, it can be easy to lose your voice. Many individuals don't trust what you're saying or how you're feeling. Once I began to see a professional therapist on a routine basis, I felt heard for the first time in my life. Processing my feelings and emotions brought healing because someone was willing to listen. I learned to trust my therapist, which made them able to recommend techniques that can help me to find relief for schizophrenia.

I'm much more intentional with listening and providing my undivided attention to my family members and friends when they've needed support. Although I may not always be able to relate to their specific struggle, I understand that active listening can help them in whatever they’re going through.

Focus More on Others
In my experience of dealing with a mental health disorder, I've found it easy to be consumed by my own issues. I tend to focus most of my attention on myself, especially during my depressive episodes and when I’m facing a lack of motivation.

Although it may feel inconsistent and even dramatic, focusing more on the welfare of others has allowed me to find relief for my symptoms. My challenges can often feel heightened and out of control, but when I make a point to inquire about the well-being of others and their current state, it allows me to avoid focusing too much on my own feelings throughout the day.

Becoming more generous to my coworkers and friends is so rewarding. Plus, it has often improved my mood, which has worked as a form of treatment for my condition. Making other people smile, laugh, or benefit from my support allows me to have a purpose in life instead of becoming lost in my diagnosis and feeling overwhelmed by it.

When I ignore the needs of others, my selfishness takes over. It allows me to use my mental health condition as an excuse to avoid making a positive change in the world.

Remaining Vulnerable
It can be challenging to remain vulnerable with other people when they may have a lack of understanding of your situation or mental state. Due to fear, I've often limited how much I've opened up to others because I've assumed they can't relate. After a few years of practicing empathy and vulnerability, I've learned that my personal experiences have value and can benefit others. I don't need to have the same background or struggle to make a connection with someone. Just by being there and listening, I can provide support to someone struggling with an addiction or going through a divorce.

Although it will likely take a lifetime to learn how to navigate my mental health issues and cope with my symptoms, practicing empathy has allowed me to grow as an individual. It has prevented schizophrenia from becoming my identity. I feel confident in my ability to extend a hand to others when they're suffering, which has allowed me to finally find a silver lining in my mental health issues.


Each year I face the dreaded anniversary of a traumatic five-minute long event — an armed robbery, which has affected nearly every area of my life. As with many people, seasonal changes, which I call seasonal triggers, bring on a flood of memories of that event. In my case, the seasonal triggers are shortened days and colder, cloudier weather.

It could happen again
For several weeks each year, I feel like I am practically re-living the trauma. When the colder, cloudier weather comes, and I find myself walking alone in mall parking lots, restaurant parking lots, or any parking lot, I am usually thinking to myself, “It could happen to me again, right here, now.”

Warm and cozy
During the cold months of the year, I spend a lot of time resting at home in an effort to calm my anxious soul. I’m not working off many pounds, but I have many hours to practice my deep breathing techniques, and slowly page through home decorating magazines while drinking hot cocoa.
As bedtime approaches, I prepare for sleeping by feeding myself a steady diet of peaceful thoughts, comedies or magazines, and keep my distance from scary or violent movies and news shows.
I am a flowering plant that takes great care to nurse back to health after a strong storm. The dream – of health – comes through much effort.

Hold on to your hats. I am flowering.
I have changed in the three years since the armed robbery. I enjoy summers more than ever before, because I can spend time with my friends under the sun, soaking up the rays, being generally carefree about life. My love for fresh fruit, well-tended gardens, and building friendships has increased. Throughout the year, I surround myself with plenty of lights or sunshine, eat foods that are good for me, and nurture my sense of humor.

I am developing a greater ability to be content in any circumstance. Whether I am at home or at work, I often find myself stopping what I am doing to enjoy the profoundly simple pleasure of being in a safe place with a roof over my head. I need practically nothing else.

Discovering what triggers your seasonal depression is half the battle. If you can’t figure it out, talk to your healthcare professional to make sure it is not physically induced. And if you do find an emotional trigger, we have confidential, free mentors who can help you process your next steps. Just fill out the form below in the "Connect" tab and you'll hear back soon.


After meeting the more urgent physical needs (like providing food, water, shelter, and medical care), the person might be ready to talk about his or her trauma. Below we give you some examples on how to help someone deal with the psychological impact of the crisis.

What might be the most important thing you can do is give the individual the opportunity to openly tell their story without interruptions or unnecessary questions. The person might find the need to repeat themselves while reliving the trauma. Be patient with them, show care while being a compassionate listener.

Express respect, empathy, and compassion. Keep them calm. Try not to show your personal feelings, especially if you are amazed or frightened. Be conscious of how you are responding to the information you are receiving. Keep your time under control and if necessary take breaks during your session.

Give them the most possible control to make decisions. The more the person is in control the better it is for them. This will help them decrease their sense of helplessness. Explore the alternatives and develop a plan of action. If they are not capable of making decisions, it might be necessary that you take control at first, but keeping in mind the goal is to help them become more independent. Be cautious of them developing an unhealthy relationship of dependency towards you.

Explore with the person what their mechanism is on dealing with the situation. How do they tend to respond when dealing with stress? What helps them deal with the actual situation?

Explore with the individual their current support system (family, friends, church, etc). How is this support system helping? What other resources are available (The Red Cross, faith-based organizations, or others)?

Be aware the current trauma can possibly bring to surface past traumas (abuse, emotions related to war, loss of loved ones or others).

You might want to ask what might help them in their recovery process (possibly having a memorial service, or a meeting with others for mutual consolation).

Keep in mind this person is a survivor and not a victim.

In a timely matter, try and have a session with someone of trust, who can help you evaluate the interaction you have had with the person in crisis. Talk about everything you saw, heard, felt, and experienced.

Characteristics of a Trauma
Dr. D. J. Schwartz describes how a person feels when facing a crisis:

Sense of perplexity (dilemma): “Never before have I felt this way.”
Sense of danger: “I feel fearful, something bad is going to happen.”
Sense of confusion: “I can’t think with clarity, as though my mind no longer functions.”
Sense of deadlock: “I feel I’m at a dead end, I have no alternatives.”
Sense of desperation: “I know I have to do something, but I don’t know what to do.”
Sense of apathy: “Nothing can help me, why bother?”
Sense of helplessness: “I can’t try it on my own, please help!”
Sense of urgency: “I need the help now!”
Sense of discomfort: “I feel so unhappy and wretched.”


Fear keeps us in the background. It convinces us we can never accomplish our dreams, tells us to keep quiet, and separates us from the ones we love. Fear has an unparalleled ability to freeze us in our tracks and limit what we are willing to try. Fear makes us lead a smaller life.

The things that we are afraid of may be different, but our reactions to fear are usually the same – our palms sweat, our mouths get dry, our stomachs churn — and we would do anything, make any sacrifice, just to make it go away. How many times have you turned away from an opportunity or even a relationship because you were too afraid to go for it?

Fear is not a bad thing. It exists for our protection as an early warning signal. But there is a big difference between the healthy fear that tells us to avoid real dangers and a crippling fear that keeps us from living our life. Dr. Henry Cloud, counselor and author, in his article “Overcoming Fear,” recommends several active steps we can take to battle the fear that controls us – connecting with others, creating structure, learning relaxation techniques, developing a spiritual life, and facing your fears. Fortunately for us, there are practical ways to take the doctor’s advice.

Connecting with others
All fears, no matter how big or small, are worse when we face them alone. Find a good friend to share your fears with, or connect with a free and confidential mentor available through this website. We tend to resist admitting our fears because we are afraid that the person will think less of us, that they will laugh or make things worse. Find someone you can trust, possibly a counselor, maybe a relative or trusted friend and share what’s bothering you. They may be able to help you see what you’re afraid of in a new light, and they will be there to stand by you and encourage you as you take steps to face your fears.

Create structure
If it’s a new, precarious situation that is causing your worries, Dr. Cloud recommends building structure into your schedule to create safety. If you exercise, exercise at the same time every day; arrange to talk with a friend at the same time each week. Structure gives us a sense of security because we know what to expect. There is comfort in the familiar. If you take control of what you can, it will give you a good starting place from which to face the things you can’t control.

Learn relaxation techniques
Fear, left to grow, can lead to some serious health problems. If your fears are having a physical effect on health, learning some relaxation techniques may help you to be physically ready to face the challenge ahead. There are numerous resources online on this subject as well as a wealth of information at the library. Find the technique that works for you.

Develop a spiritual life
In times of crisis, spiritual truths that are consistent in any circumstances are a great comfort. They give us safety and familiarity and, more importantly, they give us a reason to hope. If you do not have a spiritual life or faith consider talking to a pastor or read the Bible. The book of Psalms in particular speaks to people that are facing difficulties.

Face your fears
Finally, the last step is to actually face your fears. First, it is important to note that some fears are healthy and some situations should be avoided for your own personal safety. There are no hero points awarded for going into a personally threatening situation. However, if the threat is more mental than physical, looking at it in the face, recognizing the limits of our control, and figuring out a way forward can all help.

Don’t forget that it is often easiest to do this in steps. If your biggest fear is loss of income or health (and it is for the majority of us), start by establishing a budget based on your current income, or planning a healthier lifestyle, and gradually work up from there. Facing your fears is a process. The first step is always figuring out how you will face this day, today.

I used to sit on the banks with a raft and watch the water roll lazily by. One day I pushed my raft into the shallows of the water and found the water moved swifter than I thought. My raft was actually a boat. Then, after some time, I rowed my little boat into deeper water. There were great storms, mighty winds, tremendous waves, and sometimes I felt so alone. But I have noticed my little rowboat is now a mighty ship manned by my friends and loved ones; and beautiful calm seas, warm sunny days, and nights filled with comfortable dreams always double after a storm.

It is amazing what we accept as truth if we hear it enough times. Has something like this ever happened to you: You take a risk and get a drastic haircut. You look fabulous. You leave for work the next day in your favorite outfit feeling like a million bucks, You think “I’m so glad I did it, I love it!” You step into the elevator at work and someone turns to you, frowns, and says, “Oh, you cut your hair. What made you do that?” Your hand goes to your hair and you’d give anything for a hat. You feel terrible. Why did you have to go and cut your hair?

Self-esteem is an issue for many women. In these days of ultra-thin models and SuperMom expectations, it shouldn’t surprise us. What is surprising is how quick we are to accept another person’s judgment, and how serious our lack of faith in ourselves can become. For me, it started during high school because of a group of four or five guys who told me that I was stupid and ugly every single day. I believed them.
It didn’t matter that I came from a home where both parents still loved each other and there was a steady supply of love and encouragement. It didn’t matter that my grades were excellent and that I had a best friend who had stuck by me since third grade. I was told that I had no value and I believed them with all my heart. My self-esteem was at an all-time low and it almost killed me.

What is self-esteem?
Self-esteem can be hard to define. More than just feeling good about yourself, taking pride in your accomplishments, or liking what you see in the mirror, self-esteem is concerned with the way we evaluate our own worth. In his book, Foundations of Psychopathology, Dr. John Nemiah defines self-esteem as the “ability to look upon yourself as having value.”

We tend to look at the equation backward. We think that how we look dictates our level of self-esteem when in fact it is our self-esteem — our ability to see ourselves as having value — that dictates how we react to the face in the mirror.

Impact of low self-esteem
As my confidence faltered and my self-esteem withered away, I stopped talking in class, in groups, and in the hallways. I dreaded lunch hour, refused to step foot inside the cafeteria, and became literally sick at just the thought of giving a class presentation. I withdrew and stopped smiling altogether.

Convinced I was worthless, I stressed over every test and paper even though my grades were consistently excellent. My whole life revolved around being as invisible as possible. I thought that I couldn’t get hurt if everyone forgot I was there. The situation continued and I needed a way out. I couldn’t imagine anything that could help me. And I wasn’t dreaming about an escapist fantasy either — I was actually imagining ending my life. My experience is a common one.

Low self-esteem and depression
Low self-esteem does not necessarily lead to depression, but studies have shown that the two often go hand-in-hand. In fact the World Health Organization (WHO) uses low self-worth in its description of depression. Low self-esteem makes you your own worst enemy. Thoughts of “if only I were prettier, if only I was good at sports, if only I was funny or popular, if only I was strong enough to fix this” crowd out everything else. Even if we receive praise, the voices inside our own heads discount it. Like Julia Roberts said in the movie, Pretty Woman, “The bad stuff is easier to believe.”

The symptoms of depression are often internalized, and so the problem may be dismissed as unimportant, hormonal, or just a part of growing up. The WHO has found worldwide that “fewer than 25 per cent of those suffering from depression receive appropriate care.” It is critically important to pay attention to low self-esteem, especially in teenagers where suicide is one of the three leading causes of death. Even as adults, low self-esteem can affect performance and advancement at work, make us a reluctant partner, or an ineffective parent. Low self-esteem affects every part of a person’s life. It is overwhelming.

Healing
For me, things did not improve, so halfway through grade 11, I transferred to a different high school. The insults stopped but I still had to face myself. Running wasn’t going to fix that. Recovering a sense of self-worth takes more than a change of scene, it requires a change of perspective.

The world is a scary place when you stop liking yourself. Going to a self-esteem conference, reading books on the topic, or seeing a counselor may help you. When I did, I finally had a sense of self worth to build upon — and then the journey of healing began. I had hope.

It took a while to undo the damage all those years had done, but it was worth it. In fact, I think I’m going to make an appointment with the hairdresser!


Rest is for the weak, right? It doesn't fit into today’s society very well. Slowing down, kicking back, and being still seems counterproductive. I know I've often felt that way. It is hard to unwind. When I take the time to rest, it’s as if I am still on the merry-go-round, spinning. What am I forgetting that needs to be done? My brain begins to check my to-do list.

Does this sound like you as well? When did we become human doings instead of human beings? Is it because our technology has made us too available? Perhaps we are truly the microwave society that wants instant results in everything, not just our meals.

The Toll of Busyness
A friend of mine told me she often needs at least three days to unwind before she can begin to enjoy her vacation. It is hard to slough off the finger snapping sensation of “do it now.” However, some people never enjoy their vacation time.

American workers are allowed an average of 10 days per year for vacation and five for holidays, compared to the average of 35 days alloted in other countries. Many employees opt not to take any of those 15 days! In fact, elsewhere in the world the US is known as the “no vacation nation.” 75% of American people polled said they don't take off for vacations. If their bosses allow it, they’d prefer to take the money instead and keep working. Why? They are afraid to lose the momentum. They worry the whole time they are away whether someone is trying to steal their jobs or envision six-foot high mounds of paperwork teetering on their desk when they return. They work extra hours to get caught up and feel tired again. Why bother?

Obesity, high blood pressure, sleep disorders, and anxiety is on the rise. Is there a correlation? Could the fact we hardly have time to rest, and may even boast about how busy we are, have a bearing on our physical, emotional, and spiritual states? Many scientists, doctors, and psychologists believe so. Our high tech, fast-paced lifestyles are slowly killing us. Article after article in medical journals and on clinical websites spout the correlation between good health and regular, restful sleep. Even our kids are pushed to the limits with before school, after school, and weekend extra-curricular activities. When do they have time to play, rest, or just lie in the yard and watch clouds turn into animal shapes?

Downtime
Technical gurus, like my son, tell me once a week I should shut down my computer, let it rest, and then boot it up again in a few hours. They also suggest putting it in sleep mode when not in use. Our bodies and our minds were designed to rest just like our computers. We all need to go into sleep mode each day and occasionally just shut down our brains and relax.

The military even allows soldiers to take R&R — rest and relaxation. The commanders understand how stressful war can be and how quickly battle fatigue can set in. A tired soldier is a danger to himself and his fellow troop members. In intense manhunts, disaster relief, or hostage situations that can last for hours if not days, police forces often switch out patrols to allow their officers a bit of downtime in order to keep them focused and sharp-witted.

Many cultures have rest time built into their lifestyles. Mandatory siesta, when the sun is at its highest, is a way of life in Mexico, Portugal, Spain and parts of Italy. In the Philippines, it is a common practice to power down for a half hour each day. It used to be common in kindergartens throughout Germany and other western countries for children to have rest time after lunch as part of their school curriculum. A few innovative corporations have experimented with allowing a 20 minute nap time for their employees and report less sick days and higher productivity.

Most religions value a time of quiet to meditate, reflect, and detox. In the Bible it says even God rested after he created the universe. If the claim is true that we are made in God's image, it would make sense to assume we are designed for rest as well. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments is to remember the Sabbath day (the seventh day in Genesis) and observe it as a day of rest. It is right up there with don’t murder or steal. Sounds pretty important in the Judeo-Christian worldview.

Time Out
If you feel frazzled, you are not sleeping well, your heartburn is worse, and your stress levels are climbing, perhaps your body, mind, and soul are letting you know you need a Sabbath day. I like to call them pajama days — days when I don’t get dressed or leave the house. I ignore the cobwebs and dust, the plies of laundry, and the ever-growing to-do list. I shut out the nagging sensation that I am not being productive. After a while, the tension in my shoulders eases and the muscles in my lower back begin to unravel.

Try it for a few hours at first. I know. This won’t be easy. Mark a scheduled downtime on your calendar and put a reminder in your phone. Put a fence around it as an important appointment with yourself and firmly say “no” when events emerge to snatch it away. Wake up with the day, not the alarm. Actually turn off the cell phone. Back away from the computer and hide the TV remote. Take a time out to nap, read, meditate, or enjoy a leisurely nature walk. "Work" up to truly resting a half day each week and encourage your family members to do the same.

Go ahead. Be a maverick. Rest! Your body, mind, and spirit will thank you.


Burnout is not fun. I would know. I’ve had it for most of my twenties.

I found the countless nights of tossing and turning in trying to both fall asleep and then stay asleep to be both frustrating and despairing. Insomnia, the two kinds of not being able to fall asleep and to stay asleep, terribly affected my sleep cycle and energy throughout the day. Let me tell you, to wake up tired is not fun.

My daily routine, because of my lack of energy, was always compromised. Making plans with others was always done tentatively because I knew there was a good chance I’d have to cancel. After canceling enough times, people began to think I was unreliable or that I was trying to avoid them. But, really, I was exhausted and needed to rest.

I was also more easily triggered - irritable - because my emotional regulation was weak. It is also not pleasant for anyone to be around someone who is easily angered over little things. People around me would call me a spaz. little did they know, though, I was in a storm of unbalanced hormones and a collage of emotions due to being tired all the time.

And, of course, I can’t forget the experience of having frequent memory lapses caused by my poor sleep, which made my day-to-day life much more difficult. I had found myself writing down many things only to forget where I wrote the reminders. Ironically cruel, I know.

Having burnout felt like living in a world where up was down and down was up. I was mostly tired during the day but had loads of energy at night. It was like running on defective batteries that were low on power and made me moody, except, of course, when I wanted to fall asleep. Unfortunately, I couldn’t just swap my batteries for new ones. I needed to heal the ones I had.

My healing process began when I made changes in my life: changes that involved eating healthy and taking pressure off myself. However, the most significant changes came when I began to forgive people who had wronged me in the past and when I became more transparent about my burnout with others.

Thankfully, my journey of recovery is still proceeding along the path of good health. I no longer experience insomnia every night and my energy levels throughout the day have been consistently healthy for months straight now. I’d say my batteries are about 80% charged.

If you have burnout, you can gain strides in healing, too. Fill out the form below, and you’ll be connected with a mentor who will walk with you on your journey toward healing.


When Is It Used?
EFT is especially useful when couples arrive at counseling in emotional distress or feel so alienated they may believe that the relationship is irreparable. They may be displaying intense anger, fear, grief, loss of trust, or a sense of betrayal in their relationship. Such strong negative emotions are thought to be expressions of protest and despair over the loss of connection and the resulting feelings of physical and emotional abandonment. They are also believed to conceal feelings of fear, helplessness, and unlovability that result when bonds are ruptured.

It is also useful for couples and individuals who have difficulty expressing emotions or who believe that doing so is a sign of weakness. At the other extreme, EFT is of help to those who have trouble regulating emotions; their intense reactivity is believed to result from emotional alarms set off by fears of abandonment. In individual therapy, the therapist forms a secure alliance with the patient that becomes a safe haven for emotional exploration and expression.

EFT has many other applications because it directly targets the emotional isolation believed to be at the core of so many forms of mental distress. For example, the fears of loss and disconnection it addresses are thought to underlie many instances of depression and anxiety and experiences of trauma. The therapy is also used to repair family bonds in instances where parent-child relationships have become troubled.

What to Expect
Expect a course of treatment that typically consists of eight to 20 sessions held once a week. After taking a history from the couple, the therapist will observe their interaction patterns. Couples will be asked to identify their most pressing issues. Through observation, listening, and questioning, the therapist comes to understand the unspoken fears and insecurities that underlie negative interaction patterns.

The first several sessions are typically devoted to de-escalating the emotional reactivity and distress couples experience, especially if their life outside the therapy office. Couples learn to expand their emotional response patterns so that they can recognize and be responsive to their partner’s needs.

The second stage of therapy is devoted to restoring a deep emotional bond between partners. The goal is to create a sense of security that allows partners to share their vulnerabilities, provide comfort for each other, and serve as a secure base for exploration of the world and individual and partnership growth.

An EFT therapist is not just an observer but an active participant in the therapy. A very important part of the therapy is reframing such distancing behavior as anger or withdrawal not as pathology but as misguided bids for connection. That allows partners to express their deep feelings for each other and what they need from their partner.

The last few sessions consolidate the gains made in the previous sessions. For example, with their mutual support system now restored, couples are typically asked to discuss an old or ongoing problem so that they can develop new solutions. Patients get to practice comforting and connecting rather than disconnecting in the face of difficulty, as they understand the true emotional needs that formerly drove their negative patterns.

How It Works
Emotion-focused therapy puts emotional experiences and reactions front and center in therapy. It is based on attachment theory and the importance it places on connection to others as a source of feelings of comfort and safety and a vehicle for growth and development. Those others may be flesh-and-blood partners from whom one is currently experiencing a sense of alienation. Or they may lie within—the mental representations we all have of important figures in our lives, around which we often shape our relationships. Or they may be parts of ourselves.

Our need for others is built into the brain. Only connection provides the sense of safety we need to grow, risk, develop, and explore the world. In its absence, the nervous system is aroused; people are pitched into vigilance for danger, avoidance of risk, and a sense of helplessness, which, EFT holds, are key risk factors for all mental health problems.

Whether working with actual partners, in couples therapy, or mental representations of relationships in individual therapy, EFT explores the nature of our connections and the emotions they generate. It also helps people actively restructure those relationships so that they pave the way for new, more rewarding experiences.

For all its roots in attachment theory, EFT works very much with the reality of existing relationships and the emotions they generate. Patients come to understand how their negative interaction patterns are typically related to attachment-related fears of loss. Under the direction of the therapist, they learn to openly discuss their fears, identify the attachment needs that their fears mask, and instead of distancing themselves, use their vulnerabilities to seek closeness. From that position, they can readily solve life’s problems together.

What to Look for in an Emotionally Focused Therapist
An EFT therapist is a licensed mental health professional who has additional training and experience in EFT. The International Centre for Excellence in Emotionally Focused Therapy (ICEEFT) works with groups around the world to provide certification.

Like other therapists, EFT therapists are trained to listen empathically to patient problems, see the perspective of all parties in a relationship, and recognize the often-hidden points of conflict and their sources. They are skilled at reframing problems so that all parties see the positive aim in even the most negative behaviors. Reframing is critical in helping couples find better ways of understanding each other and relating to their partner.

Experience counts: It is advisable to seek a therapist who has had not just extensive training but experience using EFT to treat patients presenting with concerns such as yours.

As with all forms of therapy, it is important to find an EFT therapist with whom you feel comfortable. Look for someone with whom you can establish clarity of communication and a sense of good fit.
